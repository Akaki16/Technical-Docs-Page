                        freeCodeCamp is a nonprofit, open sourced organization that acts as an interactive learning
                        platform to teach anyone how
                        to code multiple programming languages. fCC also comprises of an online community forum and chat
                        rooms to further
                        support their friendly learning environment. The lessons start out with tutorials and
                        instructional programming and
                        advance to personal projects and have the students be a part of other nonprofits to build web
                        applications. With all of
                        these tools and resources available the students gain practical developer experience and
                        knowledge.

                        Launched in October of 2014, freeCodeCamp was founded by the great Quincy Larson. Quincy is a
                        software developer who
                        took up programming after graduate school and used these skills to create fCC. His vision was a
                        way for pupils to have
                        the tools to advance from beginners to job ready developers.[1]

                        Responsive web design suggests that the approach of designing and developing a website should
                        repond to the user's
                        behavior and enviornment based on platform, orientation and screen size. The practice consists
                        of a well organized HTML
                        structure and a mix of flexible grids, customizable layouts and images of intelligent use of CSS
                        and it's media queries.
                        For example, as a user switches from a laptop to a tablet or phone, the website will
                        automatically switch media to
                        accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abiliities. To put simply, the website will
                        have the technology to
                        automatically respond to the user's preferences and different devices. This eliminates the need
                        for multiple different
                        design and development phases for each new gadget that is new to the market.[3]

                        A depection of the different sizes of devices that responsive web design needs to account for.
                        Screens come in many resolutions and sizes that responsive web design needs to take account for.
                        Now that you are familiar with what freeCodeCamp and responsive web design are and have to
                        offer, this article will
                        reference the main sections of responsive web design taken from the beta version of
                        freeCodeCamp. If you're ever stuck

                        Hyper Text Markup Language, or better known as HTML, is a markup language to describe the
                        structure of a web page much
                        like a skeleton of a human body. An array of unique syntax of elements are used to organize and
                        give information about
                        the content to the web browser. Opening and closing tags are used on elements that surround
                        content and gives meaning to
                        it. There are different element tags that have different functions and uses that could include
                        paragraphs, headers,
                        links or lists.[4]

                        This section references how to use HTML elements to give structure and meaning to your web
                        content. Listed below are the

                        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
                        conforms to the ECMAScript
                        specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It
                        has curly-bracket
                        syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

                        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10]
                        Over 97% of websites use
                        it client-side for web page behavior,[11] often incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All
                        major web browsers have a
                        dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.

                        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
                        programming styles. It has
                        application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
                        standard data structures,
                        and the Document Object Model (DOM).

                        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                        graphics facilities. In
                        practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

                        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components
                        of other software
                        systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.

                        Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax,
                        and respective standard
                        libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

                        A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript
                        function is executed when
                        "something" invokes it (calls it).
